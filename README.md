Novel.js is a versatile, lightweight JavaScript text game engine that works directly in the browser.

It is suitable for interactive fiction such as "choose your own adventure" games and other kinds of text-based entertainment. It also works well as a base for straightforward prose frosted with images and sounds. It requires only a `game.json` file containing all the text, choices, items and so on, an `html` file to display the game and optionally a stylesheet (`skin.css`), images and sounds.

Novel.js is written in CoffeeScript, HTML and SASS and depends only on Vue.js. It was born out of a need for a lightweight, easy-to-use but fully-featured text adventure system that could easily be embedded on a webpage. It is open source (MIT License) and free to use both commercially and non-commercially.

## Installation

### Non-techy installation

1. Download the [latest release .zip](https://github.com/Nanofus/novel.js/releases/latest) and extract it.
2. Uncomment the commented `<script>` tags in `index.html`.
3. Upload the folder to a web server, such as Dropbox. (Opening `index.html` locally does not work, as the browser cannot load `json` files locally!)
4. Open the location in web browser. Check dev tools (usually F12) for logs.
5. Start working on `game/game.json`!

### Techy installation

1. `npm install novel-js`.
2. Create an `index.html` file and include the [HTML](#html-structure) in it. Include Novel.js (`node_modules/novel-js/novel.min.js`) and Vue.js scripts.
3. Create the folder `game` and a `game.json` inside it.
4. Use a web server of your choice or use `npm install http-server` -> `http-server` -> open `http://localhost:8080/`
5. Start working on `game.json`!

## Getting Started

Novel.js comes with a simple example game that demostrates all available features. Located in the `game` folder, `game.json` is easily readable and editable in your favourite text editor, so you can start working on your masterpiece right away! For a complete explanation of all the different stuff you can find in that file, please see the documentation!
